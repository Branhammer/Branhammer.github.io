                    <p>Featherweight Camera is an android utility that allows users to take pictures and upload them directly to a Facebook album. Thus, the app saves users a few button presses and sharing headaches. However, I feel it's greatest value comes in with how it preserves space. Immediately after the photos are uploaded they are deleted from the local memory, leaving that storage room available for music and other data. I built Featherweight Camera primarily as a portfolio piece. I wanted to learn how to use API's and to brush up on some Java skills.</p>

                    <p>Validation is an android application based off of the concepts so clearly displayed in the short film <a href="">Validation</a>. The idea is that everyone possesses admirable attributes. Sometimes just a prase or quote can change our self persception. Validation is a tool to help people uplift and compliment those around them... or even themselves.</p>

                         AllPat is a patent drafting company. I co-founded the group with my brother, a practicing patent attorney. The idea is that organizations with in-house patent counsel either have excess patent work or they would like to make better use of their lawyers time. The AllPat service frees attorneys to work on material more sensitive to their attention.
